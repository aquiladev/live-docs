# Resolve D-Website in a Browser

It will take some time for the IPFS website transaction to resolve on the blockchain after the transaction is signed with the userâ€™s wallet. After the domain records are updated, the decentralized website will resolve in certain browsers and browser extensions.

## Compatible Browsers and Extensions

The following is a list of compatible browsers and extensions for decentralized websites:

* [Opera](https://unstoppabledomains.com/opera) for desktop and mobile (supports .crypto)
* [Brave](https://unstoppabledomains.com/brave\_pa) for desktop and mobile (supports .crypto)
* [Google Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unstoppable-extension/beelkklmblgdljamcmoffgfbdddfpnnl?hl=en-US\&authuser=0) (supports all Unstoppable Top Level Domains)
* [Firefox Extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/unstoppable-extension/) (supports all Unstoppable Top Level Domains)
* [Unstoppable Browser](https://unstoppabledomains.com/browser) (supports .crypto and .zil)

## Add a Custom DNS to Your Browser

Once you have configured your browser according to this guide, you will be able to access .crypto Unstoppable domains in two different ways:

1. \`[http://domainname.crypto\`](http://domainname.crypto\`) note **http** not https
2. **domainname.crypto/** the **forward slash** is to override your browser's search engine searching for the domain.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have the Unstoppable extension in your browser you will need to disable it to switch to DNS over https (which retains the domain name in the browser).
{% endhint %}

The following table provides the configuration options for different browsers in order to view d-websites.

{% hint style="info" %}
This guide is for resolving .crypto domains in the browser. To resolve .zil or other top level domains, you will either need the [browser extension](https://unstoppabledomains.com/extension) or the [Unstoppable Browser](https://unstoppabledomains.com/browser).
{% endhint %}

## Resolve Using a Gateway URL

You can also resolve a decentralized website using a gateway URL, such as the ones provided by [Blockscan](http://blockscan.com) or [Pinata](https://docs.pinata.cloud/gateways/dedicated-gateways).&#x20;

IPFS gateways provide workarounds for applications that do not yet support IPFS natively, which allows those browsers and tools to access IPFS content. See the resource guide on [IPFS Gateways](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/ipfs-gateway/#overview) for more information.

## **Resolve a Traditional DNS record with an Unstoppable Domain**

In order to set up a redirection to a traditional domain, you will need to do a redirection via index.html on your blockchain domain so users are sent to a traditional domain.&#x20;

* On your computer, open a text editing software (for example: Notepad for Windows or TextEdit for Mac) and paste the following code.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>HTML Meta Tag</title>
<meta http-equiv = "refresh" content = "1; url = YOUR WEBSITE URL HERE" />
</head>
<body>
<p>YOUR WEBSITE DESCRIPTION HERE </p>
</body>
</html>
```

* Replace YOUR WEBSITE HERE with your URL and YOUR WEBSITE DESCRIPTION HERE with a short description of your website and save the file as **index.html** (do not use any other name).
* Open index.html from your hard drive to see if everything is working before proceeding. Right-click the file and select "**Open with**" followed by your browser of choice.&#x20;

![Right click to 'Open With' a specific or preferred browser](../../.gitbook/assets/open-with-specific-browser.png)

* Go to the **My Domains** section of our website, click **Manage** over the domain you wish to redirect, and click the **Website** tab.

![Locate the Website tab under My Domains -> Manage](../../.gitbook/assets/website-tab-manage-domains-version2.png)

* Scroll down to **Upload Files to IPFS** and click **Upload**.

![Locate the IPFS File Uploader tool in Manage -> Website](../../.gitbook/assets/ipfs-file-uploader.png)

* **Browse** for the index.html file located on your computer and Click confirm.
* Scroll down further and click **Confirm Changes**.
